# Omicron Nuker
This is a free nuker for those people in my server that keep begging for me to release a free discord server nuker + other free tools.
If i see a 25% increase of members in my server, i might update it so you don't get rate limited.

# Requirements
- **[Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) must be installed.**
- After installing python, make sure to check the box in bottom left corner `ADD TO PATH`
- **To run this double click on `start.bat`**

# Disclaimer
I am not responsible for how irresponsible you use this tool. If anything happens to your discord account or you get in trouble, you are responsible for it. Me, the owner, creator and founder of this tool isn't responsible for your unethical actions.
